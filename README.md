I believe everybody (ok, most of, not every) would have come across this Casio pocket calculator (model: MG-880) game called digit invader in childhood if one is born before 1989. This project is an attempt to remake it. I know there are already a number of remakes out there but I have to say I feel they are not good enough because they are loosely stick to the original game specifications, which I think is actually very important.
